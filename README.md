# Gems
To make your first jewelry you need to get geode from deepslate with geologist's hammer.

Geode can be sawed using stonecutter (shift + right click).
The stone wich geode contains can be either vanilla or gem from this mod.
Gem can be polished using grindstone (shift + right click) and then it will be ready to use in jewelry craft.
Every jewelry has its own abilities when you wear it

Also this mod introduces new tools better than netherite and each one has its own ability.
To craft this tools you will need rare geode called rich geode and get omnishard from it.
Omnishard can be polished to omniessence but can't be used in jewelry craft.
You need to smith your netherite tool (sword, axe or pickaxe) with omniessence using any polished gem as a template

Omnisword gives you random buff and random debuff to your enemy every time you hit him

Omnipicaxe swaps between silk touch, fortune 3 and nothing (other enchantments aren't affected) and also can mine geodes like geologist's hammer

Omniaxe drops from 2 to 5 planks of the same wood type when you strip a log
